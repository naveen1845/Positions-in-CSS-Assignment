In web design, relative positioning shifts an element from its default position without disrupting the layout of other elements. It moves relative to its closest positioned ancestor or the initial containing block. On the other hand, absolute positioning removes an element from the normal flow, placing it based on specified top, right, bottom, or left values. The element is positioned relative to its closest positioned ancestor or the initial containing block. This method doesn't affect the layout of other elements, allowing precise placement on a webpage. Both positioning techniques offer flexibility in controlling the arrangement of elements in Cascading Style Sheets.
